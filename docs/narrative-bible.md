# Tidewrack — Narrative Bible

The single source of truth for story, characters, tone, and timeline. Dialogue,
design docs, and marketing copy all defer to this file.

## Logline

The new keeper of a remote Pacific Northwest lighthouse uncovers what happened
to the keeper before them — and the light offshore that answered hers.

## Setting

**Cape Marrow Light** stands on Marrow Island, a granite hump of rock and
salal off the outer Washington coast, reachable only by boat. Perpetual fog,
kelp, foghorn, cold. The year is deliberately vague — mid-century, radios and
paraffin lamps, no cell phones. Isolation is the antagonist as much as any
person.

**Tone:** quiet dread, melancholy, restraint. Closer to *Firewatch* and *Dear
Esther* than to horror. The uncanny is implied, never gored.

## Characters

- **The player** — the new keeper. Unnamed, lightly defined so the player
  projects onto them. Arrived to replace Edith after her disappearance.
- **Edith Vane** — the previous keeper, missing eleven days at the story's
  start. Meticulous, private, unraveling in her final log entries. Heard a
  light off the north rocks answering her signal and rowed out to meet it.
- **Tom Salish** — mainland harbormaster and the player's only regular contact,
  by radio. Ran Edith's last supply. Gruff, protective, knows more than he
  volunteers. Wants any findings brought to *him*, not the county.
- **The light off the north rocks** — the mystery. Never named, never
  explained in the vertical slice. It keeps the keeper's rhythm.

## Story flags (canonical)

These are set by dialogue choices and persist via `GameState`. Keep names
stable — save files and future branches depend on them.

| Flag            | Set by                                   | Meaning |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|---------|
| `skeptic`       | Logbook, choice 1                        | Player dismisses Edith's account. |
| `believer`      | Logbook, choice 1                        | Player believes something was out there. |
| `trusted_edith` | Logbook, choice 2 (true/false)           | Player will / won't share the log. |
| `radioed_tom`   | Radio conversation                        | Player has contacted Tom. |
| `lamp_relit`    | Lamp-room relight puzzle (demo content pass) | The great light is lit again; act-one gate. Read by `lamp_room.gd`. Not set in this checkout — the validator reports it as a dead gate until the puzzle lands. |

The validator (`tests/validate_dialogue.py`) reads this table: a flag set by any dialogue graph
that is not listed here fails the run, and a flag read by code that nothing sets does too. Add the
row before you add the flag.

## Timeline (fiction)

1. Edith keeps the light alone; the fog rolls in for three nights.
2. A light off the north rocks begins answering her signal.
3. Edith relights the lamp "so whoever comes next can find the way back," then
   rows out. The dinghy is never recovered.
4. Eleven days later, the player arrives to find the lamp dead and the log open.

## Arc beyond the slice (spoilers, subject to change)

- **Act 1 (demo):** relight the lamp; the light answers; first contact.
- **Act 2:** row out; discover what Edith found.
- **Act 3:** decide whether to keep the light — and the rhythm — going.
